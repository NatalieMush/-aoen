Once there was a man who was terrible at life. He failed at everything and one day he died. I just described way more people than you would like to imagine. The end. Sad day.
However he became a zombie to add to his misible life. He first ate his cat, but it wasn't easy. The cat first stabbed  body his stumic. IT HURT! Then he died again from major blood loss.
His body took a very long time to decompose, because he had no friends or family that would come to look for him. eventually, the neighbors complained of the smell.
